"""
The Agent's Memory: The State Management System.

This module is responsible for the persistence of agent tasks. It provides
a simple, file-based mechanism to save the complete state of a task to disk
as a JSON file and to load it back into memory.

This capability is the foundation for enabling agents to perform long-running,
complex tasks that may involve multiple steps or be interrupted and resumed later.
